# Kaffeina

This is a sample application created for MJ Freeway.

## About

Welcome to Kaffeina! With this application you may track your caffeine intake from various drinks and beverages. 

It's this simple:

1. Manage or Create New Beverages
    * You can add beverages with the following information: Name, Description, Caffeine Amount per serving, and Servings per container. You may access this through the dashboard links or the top navigation bar
2. Manage or Create New Log entries to track your caffeine Intake
    * You can add new log entries that contain: a beverage and a date and time, both selected by you. You can manage your Beverage Log entries through the dashboard links or the top navigation bar

## Features

* Kaffeina summarizes the most important information as Status Cards, located on the dashboard. These cards include:
  * How much more caffeine you safely intake
  * How much caffeine you currently have in your system
  * The total caffeine you have consumed over the lifetime of using this app
  * Your maximum caffeine limit
* User Registration and Logins
* UI CRUD features for Beverages
* UI CRUD features for Beverage Logs
* Easy User and data seeding using environment variables (dotenv/.env)
* Custom Kaffeina configuration file with defaults and using .env (config/kaffeina.php)
* Polymorphic relationships and utility functions for users, beverages, and log entries
* Vue Bootstrap DateTime Picker component, customized to show a more complete Vue component
* Custom Webpack config with versioning, browsersync, autoloading, and sourcemaps
* Progess bar indicating percentage towards maximum caffeine amount
* Mobile and responsive
* User cannot add log entries that would take them over their maximum caffeine amount
* Caffiene intake allows log entries to fall off after a specific time, so that the current intake is calculated only from log entries within a specified time. This is easily set in either `config/kaffeina.php` or `.env` as `kaffeina.settings.caffeine_expiration_time` and `KAFFEINA_CAFFEINE_EXPIRATION_TIME`, respectively. A default of 6 hours ensures user safety, but 4 hours is used in .env as a standard.

## Setup

### Requirements

1. PHP
2. Composer
3. Node.JS and NPM
4. MySQL
5. Homestead Vagrant Box (didn't have time to setup docker script for this)

### Application Setup

1. Clone this repository: `git clone <REPLACE>`
2. Copy and modify .env: `cp .env.example .env`
    1. Make sure the following are set correctly for your system, defaults are shown:
        * `APP_URL=http://localhost`What you have to work with
        * `DB_CONNECTION=mysql`
        * `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`
        * `DB_PORT=3306`
        * `DB_DATABASE=kaffeina`
        * `DB_USERNAME=homestead`
        * `DB_PASSWORD=secret`
    2. Additional variables, specific to Kaffeina:
        * `KAFFEINA_CAFFEINE_EXPIRATION_TIME=4`             # How long for caffeine to leave your system. This is anywhere from 4-6 hours typically
        * `KAFFEINA_CREATE_TEST_USER=TRUE`                  # create the test user?
        * `KAFFEINA_TEST_USER_NAME="Kara Thrace"`           # test user name
        * `KAFFEINA_TEST_USER_EMAIL="demo@kaffeina.test"`   # test user email
        * `KAFFEINA_TEST_USER_PASSWORD="secret"`            # test user password
        * `KAFFEINA_TEST_USER_MAX_CAFFEINE_AMT=500`         # test user maximum caffeine amount
        * `KAFFEINA_DEV_SEED_BEVERAGE_DEFAULTS=TRUE`        # Seed predefined beverages
        * `KAFFEINA_DEV_SEED_BEVERAGE_AMOUNT=0`             # Additional random beverages
        * `KAFFEINA_DEV_SEED_USER_AMOUNT=0`                 # Additional random users
3. Generate a new application key: `php artisan key:generate`
4. Create a new database for Kaffeina (named kaffeina or whatever you put in .env)
5. Install PHP dependencies: `composer install`
6. Install Node dependencies: `npm install`
7. Run the live server: `npm run watch`

At this point, you should have an open browser with the website open. You can either register a new user, or use the default user listed in your `.env`

There are further directions upon logging in. Enjoy!

I love caffeine... I need an application that will tell me if I am having safe levels of caffeine. Assuming that 500mg of caffeine is safe. I need to be able to select one of my favorite drinks, tell you how many I consumed. You need to tell me how many more of my favorite drinks I can have to stay in a safe limit.

### Favorite Caffeinated Drinks

| 5 Hour Energy | And amazing shot of get up and go! Each 2 fl. oz. container has 200mg of caffeine to get you going. |

### What you have to work with

You have been provided your own development box. It has Amazon Linux installed with, nginx, PHP, mysql setup for you. If you install your linux project into /var/www/project, it should just work for you. If you need to adjust your nginx config, it is located at /etc/nginx/conf.d/project.conf. A blank MySQL db has been created for you if you need it called project. The mysql instance is installed locally and you should have received your credentials separately.

| Item | Description |
